\value{
Generate something akin to a rose plot in which the width and
length of each petal are directly specified by the user. Or to put it
differently, this is somewhat like a pie chart in which the radius of each
wedge is allowed to vary (along with the angular width, as pie charts do).
As an additional enhancement, one can specify a central disk of arbitrary
radius (from 0 to 1, assuming that the plot itself is scaled to the unit
circle), in which case the petal heights are always measured from the edge
of the disk rather than the center of the circle; if desired, text can be
added in the center.

Although this kind of plot may already be well known in some circles (no
pun intended), I haven't seen it clearly defined or labeled anywhere, so
I'm anointing it an 'aster' plot because its component parts are
reminiscent of composite flower morphology.

The 'lengths' dictates how far out each petal extends, 'widths' dictates
the (angular) width of each petal, and 'disk' gives the relative radius of
a central donut hole. If no widths are provided, all petals will have equal
widths. Additional function arguments can also control whether petals are
labeled, whether the petal lengths are rescaled to the maximum score or to
a user-input score, whether spokes delineating each petal are extended to
an outer circle, and more. I also wrote a quick convenience wrapper for
creating a legend plot.

Note that the function here is a repurposed and very heavily modified
version of the windrose() function contained in the 'circular' package,
although sufficiently rewritten so as not to depend on any functionality in
that package.
