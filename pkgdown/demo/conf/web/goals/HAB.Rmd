### Goal Description

Habitats conditions are considered as a proxy for condition of the broad suite of species that depend on them. The Habitats sub-goal includes all habitats in the study area, and assess their health condition and coverage area.

### Model & Data 

The Habitat model assessed all habitats for which at least some global data were available, specifically: mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass beds, salt marshes, sea ice edge, and subtidal soft-bottom habitats. Status was calculated as the average of the condition estimates for each habitat present in a region, measured as the loss of habitat and/or percent degradation of remaining habitat. 

Below are the data sets for this goal.

### Reference points 

A temporal reference point (ie. coverage data of a historical point) was used for each type of habitat. We generally considered the reference years to be between 1980-1995, although these varied by habitat due to data availability.
