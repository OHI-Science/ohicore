<p><strong>Q: Are regional assessment scores comparable with global assessment scores?</strong></p>
<p>A: Regional Index scores cannot be directly compared to global Index scores, or to other regional Index scores calculated through separate efforts. This is because data and indicators (both what they measure and their quality), reference points (set using local knowledge and priorities), and specific goal models are often different for the areas being compared.</p>
<p>However, because scores for each goal are scaled to a reference point, qualitative comparisons can be made. For example, a score of 71 in the US West Coast compared to 66 in Brazil says that the US West coast is closer to fully meeting its sustainable goals (i.e., meeting regional reference points). Furthermore, use of the same Ocean Health Index framework across regional assessments permits fruitful discussion and general comparisons even if data inputs differ. Ocean Health Index assessments at any scale always work within a standardized definition of ocean health, using information to capture the philosophy of the ten goals that have been identified (and undergone scientific peer-review) prior to compiling relevant data. Use of the ten-goal framework is important both to ensure that all aspects of ocean health are captured and to allow better comparison across regional assessments than would be possible if the different regions used different methods.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How does the Index account for ecosystem benefits?</strong></p>
<p>A: The OHI is not an index of ecosystem services. The Index prefers to describe benefits from a healthy ocean and emphasize their relevance, but the ideas are closely related. The ten goals roughly fall into areas of ecosystem services such as food provisioning (Food Provision), regulatory services (Carbon Storage), cultural services (Tourism and Recreation,Special Places), supporting services (Clean Waters, Biodiversity), and other values (Livelhoods and Economies) (Source: OHI Baltic workshop).</p>
<p><strong>Q: Where is climate change measured in the Index?</strong></p>
<p>A: Four different aspects of climate change – increases in sea surface temperature (SST), sea level rise (SLR), ultraviolet radiation (UV), and ocean acidification (OA) – are included as pressures to many goals in the Index, including Natural Products, Carbon Storage, Coastal Protection, Sense of Place, Livelihoods &amp; Economies and Biodiversity. Mitigation of climate change through carbon storage is one of the ten goals.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why are food provision and artisanal fishing opportunities goals separated?</strong></p>
<p>A: These goals measure different aspects of how people relate to fishing. The catch of fish made by artisanal (small-scale, subsistence type) fisheries is captured in the food provision goal. Jobs, wages and income from both the food provision and artisanal fishing goals are captured in the livelihoods &amp; economies goal. The purpose of the artisanal fishing opportunity goal is to evaluate the opportunity for people to pursue this fishing in relation to their need to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can 10 goals really capture all the ocean’s values? Shouldn’t we talk about ocean’s values in more detailed terms?</strong></p>
<p>A: This question speaks of the interdisciplinary nature of OHI. It is a part of the design of the model. It takes experts from all fields many years to develop the 10 goals, and each goal includes different aspects. Ten goals can easily become 100. For example, the economy goal can be divided into individual goals of tourism, transportation, production, value added (eg. fish to burger) etc. However, getting solid scores for 100 goals could take more than a year or two, and trying to communicate all the information to stakeholders and managers will be cumbersome. But we can communicate with people across fields about 10 goals (and their pressures and resilience) without being overwhelming.</p>
<p>Ten goals may seem simplified. But they are useful for talking to people across fields without compromising scientific validity.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How are the goals weighted to calculate the final score?</strong></p>
<p>A: By default, we weighed them equally because we don’t have solid, better information to do otherwise, even though we understand that each goal may/should have different weights depending on regional conditions and needs. We didn’t put emphasis on goal weighing because ten individual goal scores are more important than one total score, and can tell more about the status of ocean health. If you are interested in seeing how weighing affects the total index score, you can try the following:</p>
<p>Scenario studies. The OHI framework is flexible so that you can change the weights and see how scores change.<br>
Studies on people’s preferences or management needs to weigh goals differently.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How should we compare regional scores, spatially or temporally?</strong></p>
<p>A: Temporal comparison is good for repeated measurements in one location, so that managers can see how goal conditions change and whether their policies take effect. Spatial comparison is used to compare regional differences in your country.</p>
<p>For OHI+, the most helpful comparison is temporal comparison. Management goals are different spatially, and data are different. We can’t compare spatially unless they use the same model and data. The goal of OHI is to help local agencies adapt and improve ocean resources management. Therefore it may be an unnecessary burden to compare spatially. Without worrying about comparisons, different regions can still learn from one another.</p>
<p><strong>Q: We calculate trends based on 5 years of data. Wouldn’t it be more scientifically valid to have a 20 or 30 year trend?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes you can use more years of data if available. But 5 years is a good compromise between scientific validity and meaningulness for local stakeholders. On one hand, we have to do it scientifically vigorous with a solid reference. But on the other hand, a 5-yr trend is more helpful and actionable to stakeholders than a 30-yr trend.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is OHI an internationally recognized monitoring system? What other partnership does OHI have?</strong></p>
<p>A: OHI is gaining recognition from world governance organizations, NGOs, and local governments. There is only limited amount of funds for conservation. If we work together, we can reach maximum return on investment. We partner with UCSB, who is on the scientific frontier. They innovate science and technology, develop toolbox, fill data gap, and provide technical support for local OHI assessments. Conservation International focuses on external partnerships. CI is always looking at multilateral agreements. Some of our active partnerships include:</p>
<p>The United Nations. Many countries follow UN leads.<br>
World Bank and The Nature Conservancy, who has good research on economics, and is interested in incorporating OHI in their monitoring systems that are already in place.<br>
World Wildlife Fund, who is interested in using OHI in all of their 14 global sites.<br>
Clinton Climate Initiative.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How to draw spatial boundary: ecosystem or jurisdictional boundary?</strong></p>
<p>A. We recommend jurisdictional boundary. It comes down to who will care, and who will take responsibility for the results and act on the results.</p>
<p>There seems to be overlapping between goals, for example, habitats data re used for CS, CP, and HAB.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is that double counting?</strong></p>
<p>A. No. There is no complete overlap of data. Different habitat data are used for different goals. For example, habitats good for CS aren’t necessarily appropriate for CP.</p>
<p>OHI is also human benefits-driven, not ecologically-driven. It happens that CS, CP, and HAB are affected by similar factors, but they provide non-overlapping benefits. It is the design of OHI to show the connectivity among goals. If certain habitats are good for multiple goals, there is strong incentive to focus energy and resources to protect those habitats.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Can we remove or add goals to the OHI?</strong></p>
<p>A: A lot of deliberation went into defining the ten goals, and they seem to do a pretty good job of covering many if not most ocean uses, so additional goals may not be necessary. But it could be that they eclipse or replace an existing goal.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is sector evenness?</strong></p>
<p>A: Sector evenness (also called a diversity index) is an economic concept that is included in OHI to enable comparison across many different sectors included in the Livelihoods &amp; Economies goal. This goal evaluates jobs, wages and revenues for nine marine employment sectors. The distribution of employment across these nine sectors is an effective indicator of resilience. If total employment within a community is primarily based in one or two sectors, the overall economic system will be excessively vulnerable to downturns in those sectors. Conversely, if employment is spread relatively evenly throughout all nine sectors, the overall system will be more robust and resistant to such disturbances. Overall revenue within the community will remain more stable during such downturns, and workers displaced by a downturn in their sector may be able to find employment in another sector without leaving the community. Sector evenness was used as a resilience measure for Livelihood &amp; Economies goal.</p>

<a href="#appropriate-data-layers" class="anchor"></a>Appropriate Data Layers</h2>
<p><strong>Q: Can oil spills be included in OHI?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, oil spills could be included as a pressure and in the Clean Waters goal.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is seasonal (non-permanent) sea ice included in OHI habitats?</strong></p>
<p>A: No, sea ice only includes permanent sea ice.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How is seawater used for cooling on-shore power plants incorporated into OHI?</strong></p>
<p>A: The use of cooling water for on-shore power plants would be a pressure on the ocean, since it causes entrapment of fishes, larvae, etc, and usually is circulated back into the ocean at higher temperatures (and maybe other chemicals, minerals, etc). Since the energy is coming from land-based activities, there isn’t a service that the ocean is providing that ‘benefits’ people, it is only a pressure from the OHI perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How is freshwater production through desalination incorporated into OHI?</strong></p>
<p>A: Desal would be incorporated into OHI in several places. The benefit is that there is freshwater produced, which could be incorporated into the Natural Products goal (or potentially into its own goal). Data required would be the volume of freshwater created based on the volume of seawater involved and spatial extent. Setting the reference point would not be based on how much can be produced, but some other targets perhaps set by government (percentage of the population served). Similar to the mariculture sub-goal and tourism goals, any negative effects caused by desal that affect other goals (example: species) do not influence the ability to obtain desalination targets now and in the future. Therefore, the sustainability coefficient only measures the ability to sustain that goal, but not the impacts on other goals: instead, they are taken into account as pressures when calculating the other goals. Desal should be included as a pressure similar to cooling on-shore power plants since the discharge brine is dense, doesn’t plume very well and there are chemicals involved.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Where do energy activities fit in to OHI?</strong></p>
<p>It depends. Energy could be part of a Natural Products goal, for instance, such as wave energy – but then the question is, what is the reference point? It is partially accounted for in Livelihoods &amp; Economies through sectoral jobs data. The infrastructure is also something to consider. It could also be a pressure or resilience factor if there is a measurable footprint of the activity. You may want to consider for resilience, do you have governance measures that promote more sustainable practices in the energy industry?</p>
